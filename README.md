# IoT-Based Utility Consumption Trend Prediction and Usage Management

## üìå Project Overview
This project is designed to monitor and analyze utility consumption trends using IoT-based real-time data collection. The system leverages **Flask** for the backend, **SQLite** for data storage, and **Python** for data processing and visualization. The goal is to provide insightful usage patterns and predictive analytics for better resource management.

## üöÄ Features
- **Real-Time Data Collection**: Captures utility consumption data from IoT sensors.
- **Web-Based Dashboard**: Displays consumption trends with interactive graphs.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Uses machine learning models to forecast future consumption.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system for accessing user-specific data.
- **REST API Support**: Provides APIs for data retrieval and integration with other platforms.
- **Data Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib and Plotly to generate real-time graphs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (for trend prediction)
- **API Integration**: Flask-RESTful
